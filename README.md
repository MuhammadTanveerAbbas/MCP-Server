# AI Agents with MCP Server

## Overview

This project implements AI-powered agents that interact with an MCP (Multi-Channel Processing) server to perform intelligent tasks, data processing, or automation across various input channels. The architecture is designed to be modular, scalable, and extensible.

## Features

- AI Agents with configurable behavior
- MCP server handling multi-channel data streams
- Real-time processing and decision making
- Extensible plugin system for new agents or channels
- Support for RESTful and WebSocket APIs

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js / Python (Specify which)
- **AI/ML**: OpenAI API / LangChain / Custom Models (Specify actual usage)
- **Communication**: WebSockets, REST API
- **Database**: MongoDB / Redis / (Specify)
- **Others**: Docker, Zsh, Linux (as per development environment)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js / Python (version)
- MongoDB / Redis (if used)
- Docker (optional)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-agents-mcp-server.git
cd ai-agents-mcp-server

# Install dependencies
npm install  # or pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start the server
npm start  # or python app.py
````

### Configuration

Edit the `.env` file to include your API keys, database URIs, and other config parameters.

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here
MCP_SERVER_PORT=5000
```

## Usage

* Launch the MCP server.
* Register or activate desired AI agents.
* Send requests via API or interface.
* Observe intelligent responses or actions in real-time.
